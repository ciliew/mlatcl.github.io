title: Organize Reading Groups
assignee: pt440

Organize the team's reading group, multiple if necessary (though feel free to make another mini-job if/when it becomes more than one reading group.)
This includes sending out invites to people for it, 
deciding on the format for the reading group (how formal, presentation/discussion, around a theme?) (with input from the group of course),
and making sure there are papers in the backlog to read every week.
